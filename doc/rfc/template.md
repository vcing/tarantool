A detailed description of why a described thing is needed, who needs it, and a high-level explanation of a subject (proposed feature, optimization or a complex bugfix). The description must be easy-to-understand both for a technical writer and for a developer seeing the subject in a first time.

## Detailed design

A low-level extremely detailed design of an implementation. It can contain ASCII diagrams, links to a code, mathematics.

## Rationale and alternatives

Here existing alternatives are described, and why they appeared to be worse than an implemented thing.
